### __Description__

Embrace the future of PWA (Progressive Web Application)! We built a budget tracker following the standard of PWA, which means it works on mobile devices just like native APPs. By that, it does have the following important features. 

* First, it can be installed on your home screen, and once you start the PWA from home screen, it works in fullscreen mode which gives you the same user experience as native APPs. 

* Second, it doesn't depends on network connections. If your device is offline or having unstable connections, this PWA still stores all your data and sync them when the device is back online.

### __User Story__

* I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
* SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
